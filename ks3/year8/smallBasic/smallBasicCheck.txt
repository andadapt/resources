D = 3

# Slide 3

Small Basic

Everything we have done in Small Basic so far has been using turtle to draw shapes. We are now going to look at creating text based programs.

TextWindow.WriteLine(“Text”)
This command will display the text inside the speech marks on screen.
TextWindow.Read()
This command will allow the user to enter something into the program

TextWindow.WriteLine(“Hello World”)


# Slide 4

Task

Open the Small Basic website at:
http://computing.outwood.com/smallbasic

Complete Task 1 under lesson 3, can you change the colour of the foreground/background?

Extension:

Can you use TextWindow.Write() to change the colour of your text like shown below?

# Slide 5
Progress Check
On your mini-whiteboards answer the following questions:

What would the following code do?
TextWindow.WriteLine(“Welcome to Computer Science”)

-- Speaker Notes
Answer:
It would say Welcome to Computer Science on screen

# Slide 6
Progress Check
On your mini-whiteboards answer the following questions:
What would the following code do?
TextWindow.ForegroundColor = “Green”
TextWindow.WriteLine(“This is Green”)

-- Speaker Notes
Answer:
It would say This is Green with the text being green

# Slide 7
Progress Check
On your mini-whiteboards answer the following questions:

What would the following code do?
TextWindow.BackgroundColor = “Green”
TextWindow.WriteLine(“This is Green”)

-- Speaker Notes
Answer:
It would say This is Green with the background colour being green

# Slide 8
Progress Check
On your mini-whiteboards answer the following questions:

What would the following code do?
TextWindow.WriteLine(“This is Green”)
TextWindow.ForegroundColor = “Green”

-- Speaker Notes
Answer:
It would say This is Green but the text colour would be the default colour

# Slide 9
Progress Check
On your mini-whiteboards answer the following questions:

What is the difference between:
TextWindow.Write()
and
TextWindow.WriteLine()?

-- Speaker Notes
Answer:
TextWindow.Write will not start a new line with the code that follows.
TextWindow.WriteLine will start a new line after the text in the brackets

# Slide 10
Taking Input

So you now know how to display text on screen, but what about taking input from the user, you can do this will the following command.

TextWindow.Read()
This will create a flashing cursor so the user can type something in.

Storing the Input
It is really important that when you use this command, you store what they type somewhere. To do this you use a variable. This is a name that will be used to refer to what they have entered, e.g.:

TextWindow.WriteLine(“Enter your name: “)
name = TextWindow.Read()
TextWindow.WriteLine(“Your name is “ + name)

-- Speaker Notes
Explain what this code would do.

# Slide 11
Task

Done? Screenshot your code and add it to your programming diary

# Slide 12
Task

Use the code that is given to get started and then continue creating the program so it works like the example shown.

Done? Screenshot your code and add it to your programming diary

# Slide 13
Plenary

On your mini-whiteboards answer the following questions:

What would the following program display if the user entered Pizza
TextWindow.WriteLine(“What is your favourite food?”)
food = TextWindow.Read()
TextWindow.WriteLine(“You said “ + food + “ is your fav”)

-- Speaker Notes
Answer:
It would display You said Pizza is your fav

# Slide 14
Plenary

On your mini-whiteboards answer the following questions:

Why would this program not make sense?
age = TextWindow.Read()
TextWindow.WriteLine(“What is your age?”)


# Slide 15
Plenary
On your mini-whiteboards answer the following questions:

What is wrong with this code? Rewrite it so that it would work
Text.WriteLine(“What day is it?)
TextWindow.Read()
TextWindow.Write”Today is “ + day)

-- Speaker Notes
Answer:
TextWindow.WriteLine(“What day is it?”)
day = TextWindow.Read()
TextWindow.Write(“Today is “ + day)
