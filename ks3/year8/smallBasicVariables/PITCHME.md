## Starter

On your MWB write down what the following code would do:

```basic
TextWindow.BackgroundColor="black"
TextWindow.WriteLine("     ")
TextWindow.BackgroundColor="white"
TextWindow.ForegroundColor="black"
TextWindow.Write("Hello")
```

## Small Basic - Lesson 4 
### Variables

**ASPIRE to:**
apply different mathematical calculations to programs
**CHALLENGE to:**
construct a program that makes use of variables

## Variables

Variables allow us to store data and create calculations with them.

We use variables to store the answer of calculations and/or inputs from the user.

Imagine a variable is a box and you store information in it. When you want that information you can refer to the box it is stored in.

```basic```

num1 = TextWindow.Read()
num2 = TextWindow.Read()
total = num1 + num2
TextWindow.WriteLine(total)
```

[drag=50, drop=left,flow=col]
### Tasks

Try to complete:

Task 1 - Cards Each

Task 2 - Temperature Difference

Use the code that is given to get started and then continue creating the program so it works like the example shown.

Done? Screenshot your code and add it to your programming diary

## Progress Check

On your mini-whiteboards answer the following questions:

How many variables are there in this code? What are they called?

```basic
TextWindow.WriteLine(‚ÄúNumber of pupils:‚Äù)
pupils = TextWindow.Read()
TextWindow.WriteLine(‚ÄúNumber of classes:‚Äù)
classes = TextWindow.Read()
totalPupils = pupils * classes
TextWindow.WriteLine(‚ÄúTotal: ‚Äú + totalPupils)
```

[drag=100, drop=center, flow=col]
## Progress Check

On your mini-whiteboards answer the following questions:

How many variables are there in this code? What are they called?

```basic
age = 15
yearsOff = 18 - age
TextWindow.WriteLine(‚ÄúYou are ‚Äú + yearsOff + ‚Äúbeing an adult‚Äù)
```

[drag=100, drop=center, flow=col]
## Progress Check
  
On your mini-whiteboards answer the following question:

Why would this program not multiply together two numbers and give you the answer?

```basic
TextWindow.WriteLine(‚ÄúEnter number 1‚Äù)
num1 = TextWindow.Read()
TextWindow.WriteLine(‚ÄúEnter number 2‚Äù)
answer = num1 * num2
num2 = TextWindow.Read()
TextWindow.WriteLine(‚ÄúThe total is‚Äù + total)
```

### Task
  
Try to complete Task 3 - Pocket Money

Use the success criteria to create a program to work out how much money they have left.

Done? Screenshot your program and add it to your programming diary.
Then try to complete the school trip extension task.

## Plenary
on your MWB write down what the following code would produce:

```basic
age = 13
donuts = 2
donuts_received = age * donuts
TextWindow.WriteLine("You get " + donuts_received + "üç©")
```
