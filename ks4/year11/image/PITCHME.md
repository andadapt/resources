## Image Representation
@ol
- Images are split up into pixels. Each pixel is given a binary code which represents the colour of that pixel. Each colour is given a unique binary code.
- A single bit can store two options, 0 or 1. 
- 0 is white and 1 is black. The more complex the image the more bits needed to store the colour.

## Task
In your books, work out how many different colours a 2 bit, 4 bit, 6 bit and 8 bit (1 byte) binary code can store. 

**Extension: Can you work out a rule for this?**
2 bits = 4 colours
4 bits = 16 colors
8 bits = 256 colours
Extension: 2^ùëõ  where n is the number of bits

## Factors Affecting Image File Size
Complete the fill in the blanks on factors that affect image file size.

Data or Image?
How does a computer know that 00110011 is the colour 
code for a pixel in an image and not the number 51?

Metadata
Metadata is data about data - it allows a computer to construct an image. The metadata for an image includes height, width, resolution and colour/bit depth.

## Keywords
Copy down the keyword definitions for today‚Äôs lesson:

**Pixel - the smallest element of an image. Pixels are the dots that make up an image on screen.**

**Colour Depth -  this is the number of bits used to store the colour for each pixel. The more bits used the more colours that can be represented.**

**Resolution - this is the number of pixels in an image, this is calculated by the number of pixels wide and the number of pixels high.**

## Constructing an Image
You have a series of tasks to complete, you will need to either:
Construct an image using given codes
Create the code for the image that has been created

## Discussion
Consider this question:
Why might the picture quality on the smaller TV appear better if both have the exact same resolution and colour depth?
32 inch
55 inch
Resolution: 1920 x 1080
Resolution: 1920 x 1080
Answer: the resolution is the same, but the same number of pixels are stretched over a larger area on the bigger TV, therefore the DPI is lower on the larger TV.

## Plenary

**Write down and answer the following questions in your books **
in full sentences:
**Describe how the resolution of an image affect the size of the file. [2 marks]**
@ol
- The greater the resolution the greater the file size. [1]
- This is because each pixel takes up a set amount of data, therefore the more pixels the larger the file size. [1]
@ol
2. State three things that are stored in the metadata of an image file. [3]
Any three of:
Height [1]
Width [1]
Colour/Bit Depth [1]
Resolution [1]

3. Describe the effect of reducing the colour depth of an image. [4]
The quality of the image will reduce [1] as less colours can be represented as there are fewer bits to store the colour [1]
The file size of the image will reduce [1] as there are less bits being used to store the colour of each pixel [1]

4. How many colours can be represented using a 4-bit colour depth? 
(Show working) [2]
1 mark for working, 1 for correct answer:
24 or 2x2x2x2 [1]
16 colours [1]
