##Clock Speed
@ol
- Measured in Hz
- 1 Hz = 1 cycle a second
- 1Mhz = 1 Million cycles a second
- 1 GHz = 1 billion cycles a second

## Number of cores

@ol
- Increasing the core count increases the cycles per second
- 2 core at 1Hz, can do 2 cycles per second
- 2 cores at 2 Hz, 4 cycles per second

## Cache

@ol
- Cacheform of memory, stores data and instructions
- cache is faster than RAM
- Cache 1ms Vs RAM 1000ms
