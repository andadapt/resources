## Programming beep test
Open the FOR/WHILE Loops - Programming Beep Test from Google Classroom.
Try to complete as much as you can.
Once you start having to guess the answers to questions you should pause and hit the submit button.
Donâ€™t worry you can add/change your answers later

## Python - FOR/WHILE Loops
**ASPIRE TO:** 
Apply a loop to a Python program making them easier to understand

**CHALLENGE TO:** 
Describe how a FOR/WHILE loop might benefit a program

### What is Iteration?
Iteration is the process of repeating something until a condition is met. 

**Examples are;**
FOR loop (Count Controlled)
WHILE Loop (Condition Controlled)

### Why use them?
As you can see in the 2 pieces of code, when iteration is used, fewer lines of code are needed.

Letâ€™s Take A Look
FOR loop initiated 
X variable is created
Prints the value of x (more on this later)
Starting value
Range of FOR loop
End value -1
Note Semi-Colon
for x in range(start,end):
	CODE TO LOOP
CODE NOT IN LOOP

## Teacher Demonstration
Watch the video and see how the variables change while the program is running.

## Task 1 - Name Repetition Looping
**Your turn! ðŸŽ‰**
Using a new Python window you need to follow the instructions provided in your FOR Loops Student Workbook.
Create a simple program that checks to see if a number is entered, if it is not an error message should appear.

Once completed move onto slide 4 and screenshot your program

Letâ€™s Take Another Look

FOR loop initiated 
X variable is created
Prints the value of x (more on this later)
Starting value
Range of FOR loop
End value -1
Note Semi-Colon
Step value
Step value is the value that is counted up in. In this example the value of x is increased by 5 each time, therefore printing 0, 5, 10, 15 etc. This can also be used to countdown from a larger value;

## TAME Tasks - FOR Loops
Test - Time to test your new program on Slide 9
Evaluate - on slide 21 there is an example program that has been created for you. You should answer the question.
Analyse - on slide 13 there is an example program that has been created for you. You should answer the question based on what you see in the code.
Modify - on slide 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 Read the success criteria and make the program work as it should
Modify - on slide 23, 24 and 25 you are to read the success criteria and make the program work as it should

### Iteration Reminder
Iteration is the process of repeating something until a condition is met. 

**Examples are;**
FOR loop (Count Controlled)
WHILE Loop (Condition Controlled)

**Why use them?**
As you can see in the 2 pieces of code, when iteration is used, much less lines of code are needed.

## Task 1 - Guess the Number

**Your turn!ðŸŽ‰**
Using a new Python window you need to follow the instructions provided in your WHILE Loops Student Workbook.
You need to create a program that checks user entry from an input and if the number entered matches the answer it should say well done you have guessed the number, if it doesnâ€™t it should keep asking for a number to be entered.


Once completed move onto slide 4-8 and screenshot your program

## TAME Tasks - WHILE Loops
Test - Create and test your program on Slide 10 - 12
Evaluate - on slide 19 there is an example program that has been created for you. You should answer the question.
Analyse - on slide 13 there is an example program that has been created for you. You should answer the question based on what you see in the code.
Modify - on slide 14 Read the example exam question and complete the trace table.
Modify - on slide 16, 17 and 18 you are to read the success criteria and make the program work as it should
