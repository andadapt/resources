## Starter

On your MWB solve the following anagram and give the substring indexing. i.e. word[0] + word[3]

```python
word = "tfarcemin"
```

## Python - FOR/WHILE Loops
**ASPIRE TO:** 
Apply a loop to a Python program making them easier to understand

**CHALLENGE TO:** 
Describe how a FOR/WHILE loop might benefit a program

### What is Iteration?
Iteration is the process of repeating something until a condition is met. 

**Examples are;**
@ol
- FOR loop (Count Controlled)
- WHILE Loop (Condition Controlled)

### Without a loop

```python
print("0")
print("1")
print("2")
print("3")
print("4")
print("5")
print("6")
print("7")
print("8")
print("9")
```

## Using a loop

```python
for x in range (10):
	print(x)
	```

## Teacher Demonstration
Watch the video and see how the variables change while the program is running.

## Task 1 - Name Repetition Looping
**Your turn! ðŸŽ‰**
Using a new Python window you need to follow the instructions provided in your FOR Loops Student Workbook.
Create a simple program that checks to see if a number is entered, if it is not an error message should appear.

Once completed move onto slide 4 and screenshot your program

### Letâ€™s Take Another Look

FOR loop initiated 
X variable is created
Prints the value of x (more on this later)
Starting value
Range of FOR loop
End value -1
Note Semi-Colon
Step value
Step value is the value that is counted up in. In this example the value of x is increased by 5 each time, therefore printing 0, 5, 10, 15 etc. This can also be used to countdown from a larger value;

Look at the code below;

How many times is line 2 repeated?

## TAME Tasks - FOR Loops
Test - Time to test your new program on Slide 9
@ol
- Evaluate - on slide 21 there is an example program that has been created for you. You should answer the question.
- Analyse - on slide 13 there is an example program that has been created for you. You should answer the question based on what you see in the code.
- Modify - on slide 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 Read the success criteria and make the program work as it should
- Modify - on slide 23, 24 and 25 you are to read the success criteria and make the program work as it should

## Plenary

On your MWB write down what would happen with the following code:

```python
for x in range(100):
	print(y)
```

## Letâ€™s Take A Look
WHILE loop initiated 
Condition
WHILE condition:
	CODE TO LOOP
CODE NOT IN LOOP

## Task 1 - Guess the Number

**Your turn!ðŸŽ‰**
Using a new Python window you need to follow the instructions provided in your WHILE Loops Student Workbook.
You need to create a program that checks user entry from an input and if the number entered matches the answer it should say well done you have guessed the number, if it doesnâ€™t it should keep asking for a number to be entered.


Once completed move onto slide 4-8 and screenshot your program

## TAME Tasks - WHILE Loops
Test - Create and test your program on Slide 10 - 12
@ol
- Evaluate - on slide 19 there is an example program that has been created for you. You should answer the question.
- Analyse - on slide 13 there is an example program that has been created for you. You should answer the question based on what you see in the code.
- Modify - on slide 14 Read the example exam question and complete the trace table.
- Modify - on slide 16, 17 and 18 you are to read the success criteria and make the program work as it should
