# Slide 1
Starter
Look at the code below and see if you can work out the output.
name="MickeyMouse"
print(name[0] + name[6])
Put your answer on your MWB.
Also be prepared to explain your answer

-- Speaker Notes
Answer = MM

# Slide 2
Python - Sub Strings
ASPIRE TO: Apply sub strings to meet a success criteria
CHALLENGE TO: Describe how sub strings are used in Python

-- Speaker Notes
2.2
2.2.1 Programming fundamentals
The use of variables, constants, operators, inputs, outputs and assignments
The use of the three basic programming constructs used to control the flow of a program: 
Sequence
Selection 
Iteration

#Slide 3
Sub Strings

word = input("Please enter a 5 letter word: ")
print(word[4]+word[3]+word[2]+word[1]+word[0])

Variable Name
Ask the user for a word
Outputs the character in position 4
Outputs the character in position 3

0
1
2
3
4
H
e
l
l
o

-- Speaker Notes
Students must understand that we are starting at 0 

# Slide 4 
Teacher Demonstration
Create a new variable and store 07912345691
This should be cast as a string already
Use an if to check that the first character is a 0
If it is output, “this looks like a valid phone number”

# Slide 5
Task 1 - Research 
Your turn!
Using a new Python window you need to follow the instructions provided in your Student Workbook.
Create a program that takes a 5 letter word and then reverses the letters.

# Slide 6
What’s the output?
Look at the code below;

word = "Computer Science home" 
print(word[8]+word[1]+word[2]+word[6]+word[8]
+word[5]+word[1]+word[8]
+word[6]+word[13]+word[7]+word[11]+word[14]
+word[17]+word[19]+word[6]+word[13]+word[5])


What does the code above output?

-- Speaker Notes
Come to enrichment

# Slide 7
Task 2 - Special Number
Your turn!
Using a new Python window you need to follow the instructions provided in your Student Workbook.

You need to create a program that takes a persons DOB and outputs a special Number

# Slide 8
TAME Tasks - Sub Strings
Test - test your new program on Slide 10
Evaluate - on slide 13 there is an example program that has been created for you. You should answer the question.
Analyse - on slide 6 there is an example program that has been created for you. You should answer the question based on what you see in the code.
Modify - on slide 12 Read the success criteria and make the program work as it should
